Masala dosa is stuffed dosa. The two parts are the dosa and the stuffing. The dosa is made in the usual way by soaking rice and lentils overnight in water and then grinding it to a batter. The batter will be fermented overnight to make the dosa soft from inside and crispy texture outside. The stuffing is made from boiled potatoes with a seasoning of mustard seeds and garnishing of grated coconut, pinch of turmeric powder, coriander leaves, and lemon juice.
